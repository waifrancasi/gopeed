## Step 1: Install Tanner Tools V14.1 64-bit
 
To install Tanner Tools V14.1 64-bit, you need to download the software from the official website[^4^] or from other sources[^1^] [^2^]. You also need to have a license file that matches your computer ID. You can request a license file from the vendor or use a crack file[^3^] [^5^] [^6^]. After downloading the software and the license file, you need to run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose the components you want to install, such as S-Edit, T-Spice, W-Edit, L-Edit and HiPer Verify. You also need to copy the license file to the installation folder.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Project
 
To create a new project in Tanner Tools V14.1 64-bit, you need to launch S-Edit, which is the schematic editor of Tanner Tools. You can click on File > New > Project to open the New Project dialog box. You can enter a name for your project, choose a location for your project folder, select a technology library and a simulation tool. You can also specify the units, grid size and snap settings for your project. After creating a new project, you can start drawing your circuit schematic using the tools and components available in S-Edit.
 
## Step 3: Simulate Your Circuit
 
To simulate your circuit in Tanner Tools V14.1 64-bit, you need to use T-Spice, which is the simulation engine of Tanner Tools. You can click on Simulation > Run Simulation to open the Run Simulation dialog box. You can choose the type of analysis you want to perform, such as DC, AC, Transient or Noise analysis. You can also set the parameters and options for your simulation, such as simulation time, output variables, tolerances and convergence criteria. After setting up your simulation, you can click on Run to start the simulation process. You can view the simulation results in W-Edit, which is the waveform viewer of Tanner Tools.
 
## Step 4: Model Your Circuit
 
To model your circuit in Tanner Tools V14.1 64-bit, you need to use L-Edit, which is the layout editor of Tanner Tools. You can click on Layout > Generate Layout from Schematic to open the Generate Layout dialog box. You can choose the options for generating your layout, such as layer mapping, cell placement and routing. After generating your layout, you can edit it using the tools and commands available in L-Edit. You can also verify your layout using HiPer Verify, which is the verification tool of Tanner Tools. You can check for design rule violations, connectivity errors and parasitic extraction using HiPer Verify.
